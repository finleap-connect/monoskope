# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the two most recent minor versions.

For example, if `1.4.1` is the most recent versions, we will
address security updates for `1.3.0` and later. Once `1.5.0` is
released, we will no longer provide updates for `1.3.x` releases.
